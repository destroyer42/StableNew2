# Setting	Recommended Value	Notes
# Sampler	DPM++ 2M SDE	Smooth gradients, crisp armor details
# Scheduler	Karras	Works best with realism models
# Steps	34	Optimal for SDXL + cinematic lighting
# CFG Scale	5.8	Prevents overcontrast halos
# Clip Skip	2	SDXL realism sweet spot
# Resolution	1024 × 1024	Base render (portrait ratio 1:1 or 1152×896 for scene)
# Seed	fixed for reproducibility (e.g., 3498274411)	Optional; -1 for randomness
# Restore Faces	false	Avoid global restoration
# Enable HR	true	For epic fidelity
# HR Scale	1.7	Expands scope, keeps sharp armor
# HR Upscaler	4x-UltraSharp or R-ESRGAN 4x+	Best for metallic detail
# HR Second Pass Steps	12	Refines armor edges
# Denoising Strength	0.27	Maintains consistency while refining
# CFG (HiRes pass)	6.0	Slight contrast boost for dynamic lighting
# Batch Size	1	Individual render control
# LoRAs	add-detail-xl:0.6, CinematicStyle_v1:0.5, HeroicComposition_XL:0.45	Heroic realism balance

(masterpiece, best quality) epic battlefield portrait, cinematic realism, dramatic clouds and dust, golden rim light
young captain Moroni, age 25, standing at the forefront of Nephite armies, detailed armor with bronze breastplate, iron arm-shields, and head shield
commanding presence, cloak caught in wind, holding raised sword, troops behind with swords and cimeters, morale high
in the distance the Lamanite army retreats in fear, half-armored warriors, skin girded at loins, chaos and dust, sunbeams piercing clouds
