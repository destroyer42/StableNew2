# Archived GUI V2 Tests

This folder contains legacy and experimental GUI V2 tests that do not match the current MainWindowV2 zone-map or architecture. These tests are not run by default in CI or local pytest, but are kept for reference for future phases (advanced prompt editor, learning, randomizer, job history, etc.).

Do not update these tests for Phase-1 features. Use only the core tests in `tests/gui_v2/` for current validation.
