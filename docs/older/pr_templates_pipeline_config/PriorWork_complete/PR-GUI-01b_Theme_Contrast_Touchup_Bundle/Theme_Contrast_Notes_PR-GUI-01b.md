Theme Contrast Notes (PR-GUI-01b)
=================================

Goal: Improve the readability and affordance of ghost header buttons and status labels.

- Ghost buttons (Preview/Settings/Help) should:
  - Look clearly like buttons, not plain text.
  - Stay less prominent than Run/Stop.
  - Have a subtle hover cue (slightly lighter background).

- Status labels:
  - `StatusStrong.TLabel` → readable primary status.
  - `Status.TLabel` → muted secondary status.
