PR: PR-PIPE-025 — Align config passthrough tests with sampler/scheduler normalization
NOTE: This is a guided test-update diff. Do not modify production code in this PR.

File: tests/test_config_passthrough.py

1. Locate the txt2img config passthrough test (name may vary). For example:

    def test_config_passthrough_txt2img(...):
        config = {
            "txt2img": {
                "sampler_name": "DPM++ 2M",
                "scheduler": "Karras",
                ...
            },
            ...
        }
        payload = build_txt2img_payload(run_config_from(config))
        assert payload["sampler_name"] == "DPM++ 2M"
        # previous expectations...

2. Update sampler/scheduler assertions to match the new behavior:

    assert payload["sampler_name"] == "DPM++ 2M Karras"
    assert payload["scheduler"] == "Karras"

3. If there is an img2img passthrough test with scheduler set (e.g. "Karras"), update it the same way:

    assert payload["sampler_name"] == "DPM++ 2M Karras"
    assert payload["scheduler"] == "Karras"

4. For any tests that explicitly cover cases with “no scheduler” (None / "" / "None" / "Automatic"), assert that:

    assert payload["sampler_name"] == "DPM++ 2M"
    assert "scheduler" not in payload

5. Do not alter any other expectations or unrelated assertions in this file.
